rust implementation of Teeny Tiny compiler tutorial written by [austin henly](https://austinhenley.com/blog/teenytinycompiler1.html)

I literally just followed the tutorial 1 to 1, taking some liberties to translate from python to rust.

feel free to take my code as reference, or you can file pull requests if you think there's a better way for me to do things, because my code is VERY messy. I tried adding some comments so hopefully things are just the slightest bit navigable.

ok bye now
